Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with
default parameters builds the following {partner-product-name} environment in the
AWS Cloud.

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* A VPC configured with a private subnet, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the private subnet, an Amazon Redshift cluster that stores business data for analysis, visualization, and dashboards.
* An extract, transform, load (ETL) pipeline:
** S3 buckets to store data from an MDM or similar system. Raw meter data, clean data, and partitioned business data are stored in separate S3 buckets.
** An AWS Glue workflow:
*** Crawlers, jobs, and triggers to crawl, transform, and convert incoming raw meter data into clean data in the desired format and partitioned business data.
*** Data Catalog to store metadata and source information about the meter data.
* An ML pipeline:
** Two AWS Step Functions workflows:
*** Model training, which uses the partitioned business data to build an ML model.
*** Batch processing, which uses the partitioned business data and the data from the model as a basis for forecasting. 
** Amazon S3 for storing the processed data.
** Amazon SageMaker for real-time forecasting of energy usage.
** A Jupyter notebook with sample code to perform data science and data visualization.
* AWS Lambda to query the partitioned business data through Amazon Athena or invoke SageMaker to provide API query results.
* Amazon API Gateway to deliver API query results for energy usage, anomalies, and meter outages.


Deploying MRASCO adapter

Additionally, as shown in <<architecture_adapter1>>, the Quick Start deploys the following adapter resources (in dark background) if special data adapters were selected to be deployed:

* A data pipeline to transform MRASCO data flow files to MDA landing zone format.
** S3 bucket to store raw data flow data files.
** Lambda function to be triggered on object creation and transform raw data flow data files to MDA landing zone.
